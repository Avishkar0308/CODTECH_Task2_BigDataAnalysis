👨‍💼 Internship Details

Name: Avishkar Mulik

Company: Codetech IT Solutions

Internship ID: CTO4DR449

Domain: Data Analytics

Duration: October – November 2025

Mentor: Neela Santosh Kumar

🎯 Objective

The objective of this project is to build a Machine Learning model capable of predicting customer spending behavior based on demographic and financial attributes using the Mall Customers dataset.
This project demonstrates how data-driven predictive models can assist businesses in identifying high-value customers and improving targeted marketing strategies.

📚 About the Dataset

Dataset Name: Mall_Customers.csv

Description: The dataset contains details about mall customers including:

Customer ID

Gender

Age

Annual Income (k$)

Spending Score (1–100)

Purpose: To analyze customer profiles and predict whether a customer is likely to be a high spender or low spender.

⚙️ Tools & Technologies Used

Programming Language: Python

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn

Environment: Google Colab

Model Used: Logistic Regression (Classification Model)

🧩 Process Overview

Data Loading: Import and explore the dataset.

Data Preprocessing: Handle categorical data, scaling, and feature selection.

Model Training: Train a Logistic Regression model to classify spending behavior.

Model Evaluation: Evaluate performance using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.

Insight Generation: Analyze relationships between customer features and spending patterns.

💡 Key Insights

Gender and income significantly influence spending behavior.

Customers with higher income and younger age tend to have higher spending scores.

The model achieved strong accuracy, indicating effective prediction capability.

🏁 Conclusion

This project successfully demonstrates the implementation of a predictive analytics model using machine learning.
The analysis provides useful business insights into customer segmentation and spending habits.
By leveraging such models, organizations can enhance marketing strategies, increase customer engagement, and improve overall decision-making efficiency.
